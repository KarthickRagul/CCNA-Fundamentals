# CCNA-Fundamentals

## Network Devices:

      1.  Repeator : Repeats the packets to all the ports (Layer1 device, Not mostly using these days)
      2.  **Hub** : **Not an Intelligence device**, It shares the packets to all the ports associated with it (**Layer1 device not mostly used**)
      3.  **Switch** : **It is an Intelligence device**, It shares the packets to the exact ports based on the **MAC Address**(**Layer2 device Mostly used**)
      4.  **Router** : **Used to connect one network with another network**, Deals with **IP Address**(**Layer 3 device mostly used**), Uses **Routing table for routing**
      5.  **FireWall** : It is a Hardware/Software device to control the traffic and denies the bad people, Protect us from Bad People
                     1. **Intrution Detection Service** :Warns when someone attacks (i.e small DOG warns when it see some unknown person)
                     2. **Intrution Protection Service** :It Blocks the attacks and warns (i.e big DOG blocks the intrution)
      6. **Wireless Line Controller(WLC)** :It is used to manage the Access Point's, used when you have many access point's
   
   
## OSI Model

      * 7. Application Layer    (5 to 7->Treated as a Application Layer in **TCP/IP Model**) 
      * 6. Presentation Layer
      * 5. Session Layer
      * 4. Transport Layer  (TCP/UDP)           (Segments)
      * 3. Network Layer    (Router)            (Packets)
      * 2. Data Link Layer  (Bridge/Switch)     (Frames)
      * 1. Physical Layer   (Hub)               (Bits)
      
      
## Port Numbers

      * Https : 80  * FTP : 21 * TFTP : 69 * Telnet : 23 * SSH : 22 * HTTPS : 443 * SMTP : 25
      
## Number Systems :
      * Binary (0 or 1) (Base 2)
      * Decimal (0 - 9) (Base 10)
      * Hexadecimal (0 - F) (Base 16)
