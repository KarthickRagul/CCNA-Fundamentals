# CCNA-Fundamentals

**Network Devices:**

      *  Repeator : Repeats the packets to all the ports (Layer1 device, Not mostly using these days)
      *  **Hub : Not an Intelligence device**, It shares the packets to all the ports associated with it **(Layer1 device not mostly used)**
      *  **Switch : It is an Intelligence device**, It shares the packets to the exact ports based on the **MAC Address(Layer2 device Mostly used)**
      *  **Router : Used to connect one network with another network**, Deals with **IP Address(Layer 3 device mostly used)**, Uses **Routing table for routing**
      *  **FireWall :** It is a Hardware/Software device to control the traffic and denies the bad people, Protect us from Bad People
                     *  **Intrution Detection Service :** Warns when someone attacks (i.e small DOG warns when it see some unknown person)
                     *  **Intrution Protection Service :** It Blocks the attacks and warns (i.e big DOG blocks the intrution)
      * **Wireless Line Controller(WLC) :** It is used to manage the Access Point's, used when you have many access point's
   
   
**OSI Model**

      * 7. Application Layer    (5 to 7->Treated as a Application Layer in **TCP/IP Model**) 
      * 6. Presentation Layer
      * 5. Session Layer
      * 4. Transport Layer  (TCP/UDP)           (Segments)
      * 3. Network Layer    (Router)            (Packets)
      * 2. Data Link Layer  (Bridge/Switch)     (Frames)
      * 1. Physical Layer   (Hub)               (Bits)
      
      
**Port Numbers**
      * Https : 80  * FTP : 21 * TFTP : 69 * Telnet : 23 * SSH : 22 * HTTPS : 443 * SMTP : 25
